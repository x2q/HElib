HElib
=====

HElib is a software library that implements [homomorphic encryption] [6] (HE). Currently available is an implementation of the [Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan] [1] (BGV) scheme, along with many optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation runs faster, focusing mostly on effective use of the [Smart-Vercauteren] [2] ciphertext packing techniques and the [Gentry-Halevi-Smart] [3] optimizations.

This library is written in C++ and uses the [NTL mathematical library] [4]. It is distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License] [5] (GPL).
